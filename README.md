# TravelBloom: A Dynamic Travel Recommendation Website

TravelBloom is a responsive, single-page web application designed as a final project for a full-stack development course. It serves as a modern and intuitive platform for users to explore travel destinations. The site features a dynamic search functionality that fetches and displays travel recommendations without reloading the page.
